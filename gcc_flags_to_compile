    The -ftrapv function will cause the program to abort on signed integer overflow (formally "undefined behaviour" in C).

==> -fverbose-asm is useful if you're compiling with -S to examine the assembly output - it adds some informative comments.

    -finstrument-functions adds code to call user-supplied profiling functions at every function entry and exit point.

==> -Wextra, -Wall: essential.

    -Wfloat-equal: useful because usually testing floating-point numbers for equality is bad.

    -Wundef: warn if an uninitialized identifier is evaluated in an #if directive.

    -Wshadow: warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable, parameter or global variable or whenever a built-in function is shadowed.

    -Wpointer-arith: warn if anything depends upon the size of a function or of void.

    -Wcast-align: warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the target is increased. For example, warn if a char * is cast to an int * on machines where integers can only be accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.

    -Wstrict-prototypes: warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the argument types.

    -Wstrict-overflow=5: warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the assumption that signed overflow does not occur. (The value 5 may be too strict, see the manual page.)

    -Wwrite-strings: give string constants the type const char[length] so that copying the address of one into a non-const char * pointer will get a warning.

    -Waggregate-return: warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or called.

    -Wcast-qual: warn whenever a pointer is cast to remove a type qualifier from the target type*.

    -Wswitch-default: warn whenever a switch statement does not have a default case*.

    -Wswitch-enum: warn whenever a switch statement has an index of enumerated type and lacks a case for one or more of the named codes of that enumeration*.

    -Wconversion: warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value*.

    -Wunreachable-code: warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed*.

Those marked * sometimes give too many spurious warnings, so I use them on as-needed basis.
