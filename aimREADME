Required to be a master in these
    
    Arrays, atleast double pointer array
    Linked Lists, single, double, circular
    Strings,
    Stacks,
    Queues, circular buffer/queue

Letâ€™s now learn some simple algorithms,

    Sorting - Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Bucket sort, Counting sort, Radix sort, External sorting
    Search - Linear search, Binary Search (along with its variants).
    Prime Numbers - Sieve of Eratosthenes, Primality test
    Strings - String searching, LCS, Palindrome detection
    Miscellaneous - Euclidean algorithm, Matrix multiplication, Fibonacci Numbers, Pascal's Triangle, Max Subarray problem

how to approach new problems.

1. think, draw do rough sketch.
2. write down what exactly is the problem you think, and what is the expected solution according to yourself.
3. once 2 is done, try to approach from problem to solution in plain english.
4. try to write a simple code based on this understanding.
5. analyse corner cases.
6. improve code.

=====
from stacks and queues only double queue can be done.Rest can be followed.
from linked lists, only double linked list can be done, rest can be followed.
look for implementation of these in struct form later, first do it with arrays.Understand the basic problem of these.
Undestand dynamic way of both.
